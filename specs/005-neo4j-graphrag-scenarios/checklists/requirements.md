# Specification Quality Checklist: Neo4j GraphRAG Scenarios

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond user-approved architecture constraints
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where possible; architecture terms are retained only where the user made them part of the product definition
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No unnecessary implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The feature intentionally names PostgreSQL, Neo4j, GraphRAG, and LangGraph because the user defined them as core product architecture, not incidental implementation choices.
- A separate constitution update is likely needed because the current constitution still names the older Korean scenario labels while this feature standardizes Bull/Base/Bear.
